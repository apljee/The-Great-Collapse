# The-Great-Collapse
This is the repository for The Great Collapse, a now-WIP mod being developed by apljee and Plankicorn.

The Great Collapse is being developed as a mod for HOI4, but was formerly being developed as a mod for EU4 by the same authors. We have decided to work on porting over what we worked on in the past together to a new mod, to be developed for Hearts of Iron rather than Europa Universalis. Development begun om 7/26/2018, AKA when this repository was created.
